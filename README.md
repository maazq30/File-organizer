File Organizer Script
The File Organizer is a Python script designed to automatically sort and organize files in a specified folder based on their file types.
It helps maintain a clean, structured, and clutter-free workspace by categorizing files into folders like Images, Documents, Videos, Music, Archives, Scripts, and Others.

Features:
📂 Automatically Categorizes Files by extension

🛠️ Creates Folders for each file type if not already present

🔄 Moves Files into their respective folders

🧹 Keeps Your Directories Clean and Organized

🧠 Handles Unknown File Types by placing them in an "Others" folder

How It Works:
Enter the path of the folder you want to organize.

The script scans all files in the directory.

It automatically moves files into categorized folders based on their extensions.

Unrecognized files are moved to the "Others" folder.
